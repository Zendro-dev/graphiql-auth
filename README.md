# Graphiql interface with login

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Usage


In order to run this SPA three environmental variables are expected:

`REACT_APP_SERVER_URL`: indicates the server url where a graphql API is being served. Default value is `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

`REACT_APP_LOGIN_URL`: indicates the url where the SPA will fetch for login authentication. Default value is `http://localhost:3000/login`.

`PORT`:   for dev mode, this variable allows to modify the port where the app will be listening. Default value is 7000.

Example:

`REACT_APP_SERVER_URL="http://my.server.url" REACT_APP_LOGIN_URL="http://my.login.url" PORT=9000 npm start`

In this case the app will be listening at PORT 9000, it will check login authentication at `http://my.login.url` and will connect to backend runing at  `http://my.server.url`.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Contributions
Zendro is the product of a joint effort between the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany and the Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad, México, to generate a tool that allows efficiently building data warehouses capable of dealing with diverse data generated by different research groups in the context of the FAIR principles and multidisciplinary projects. The name Zendro comes from the words Zenzontle and Drossel, which are Mexican and German words denoting a mockingbird, a bird capable of “talking” different languages, similar to how Zendro can connect your data warehouse from any programming language or data analysis pipeline.

### Zendro author contributions
Asis Hallab and Alicia Mastretta-Yanes coordinated the project. Asis Hallab designed the software. Programming of code generators, the browser based single page application interface, and the GraphQL application programming interface was done by Katja Dohm, Constantin Eiteneuer, Francisco Ramírez, Tim Rehberg, Veronica Suaste, David Velasco, Thomas Voecking, and Dan Wang. Counselling and use case definitions were contributed by Francisca Acevedo, Vicente Arriaga, Frank Fischer, Roland Pieruschka, Alejandro Ponce, Irene Ramos, and Björn Usadel. User experience and application of Zendro on data management projects was carried out by Asis Hallab, Alicia Mastretta-Yanes, Yaxal Ponce, Irene Ramos, Verónica Suaste, and David Velasco. Logo design was made by Bernardo Terroba.
